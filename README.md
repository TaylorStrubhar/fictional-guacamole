# Fictional Guacamole

## Description

We created an application for a boarding facility where a user can create an account and add pets to their account so the facility has saved information on each pet. We used Node.js as well as the bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, seed, and sequelize node packages to create this project. We deployed this app using Heroku and a JawsDB MySQL database. We styled this app with the Bulma CSS framework.
